# SQL_pizza_sales


I'm excited to share my recent project where I applied SQL to explore and analyze pizza sales data for a fictional restaurant, SHODWE Pizza Resto — Where every slice tells a story!

In this project, I stepped into the role of a data analyst for Shodwe Pizza Resto — where every slice tells a story! — and worked with real-world sales data to answer important business questions.
Using structured SQL queries, I investigated sales patterns, customer preferences, peak business hours, and revenue trends.

Here’s a deeper look at what this project covered:

Data Exploration: Understanding the structure of the sales database and preparing relevant datasets for analysis.

Sales Performance Analysis: Identifying top-performing pizzas, bestselling days, and most profitable times.

Customer Insights: Analyzing customer buying behavior and finding actionable trends that could improve marketing strategies.

Revenue Optimization: Finding which menu items contribute most to revenue and how promotions could be planned accordingly.

Technical Growth: Improving my SQL skills by writing optimized queries, managing large datasets, and generating business-ready insights.

Through this project, I realized the true potential of data — how numbers on a screen, when analyzed correctly, can tell compelling stories and drive smarter business decisions.

This hands-on experience not only sharpened my technical skills but also strengthened my understanding of data storytelling, business intelligence, and the value of customer-centric strategies in the food and beverage industry.

Key Learnings from the Project:

Data is not just about numbers; it's about understanding people behind those numbers.

Writing clean and efficient SQL queries is essential for faster and better analysis.

Small insights can lead to big business wins — like timing a discount or promoting a popular pizza flavor!

Every dataset holds hidden gems; you just need to dig with the right tools and mindset.

I am proud of how this project turned out, and it has motivated me even more to keep learning, practicing, and sharing my journey in the world of data.

If you’re passionate about data analytics, business intelligence, or simply love pizza as much as I do — I’d love to connect and exchange ideas!

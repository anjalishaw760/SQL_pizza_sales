## 📌 Project Title


Pizza Sales Analysis using SQL

📖 Brief One-Line Summary

An end-to-end SQL-based data analysis project uncovering sales insights from a pizza restaurant’s transactions.

## 📝 Overview


This project focuses on analyzing pizza sales data to extract meaningful insights that can help improve business decisions. Using SQL queries, we dive into sales trends, customer preferences, and performance indicators to answer critical business questions.


## ❓ Problem Statement


The restaurant wanted to understand:

Which pizzas generate the most revenue?

What are the peak sales times and days?

How do sales vary by pizza category and size?

Which strategies could increase revenue and customer satisfaction?


The challenge was to organize raw transaction data, query it effectively, and present insights in a clear, business-friendly format.

## 📊 Dataset


The dataset consists of transaction-level pizza sales data, including:

Order details (order ID, order date, time)

Pizza details (pizza name, category, size, price)

Sales information (quantity ordered, revenue generated)


## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies


SQL – for querying and extracting insights

PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQLite – database management (depending on setup)

Excel / Power BI (optional) – for visualization (if applied)

GitHub – project version control and sharing


## 🔍 Methods


1. Data Cleaning & Preparation

Removing duplicates and nulls

Standardizing pizza names, sizes, and categories


2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with SQL

Total revenue, orders, and pizzas sold

Best-selling pizzas (by quantity & revenue)

Revenue by pizza size and category

Daily, weekly, and monthly sales trends


3. Insight Extraction

Identifying sales peaks

Analyzing customer demand patterns

Profitability analysis by pizza type



## 💡 Key Insights


Large-sized pizzas generated the highest revenue.

Fridays and weekends had the most sales volume.

A small set of premium pizzas contributed disproportionately to revenue.

Seasonal/holiday spikes influenced ordering patterns.


## 📊 Dashboard / Model / Output


SQL queries answering 15+ business-related sales questions.

Summarized tables and reports from queries.

(Optional) Visualization dashboards in Power BI/Excel for better storytelling.
